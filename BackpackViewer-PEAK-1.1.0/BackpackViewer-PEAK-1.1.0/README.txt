# BackpackViewer-PEAK-1.1.0

## Overview

This mod allows you to inspect the backpack menu while holding it in your hand. It lets you select an item without having to drop the backpack on the groundâ€”especially useful since it often falls or glitches and flies away.

Additionally, it displays the backpack's 4 slots directly in the UI, at the top right corner (including those of other players). Everything is configurable via steamapps\common\PEAK\BepInEx\config\com.vorshim92.backpackviewer.cfg.
